[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/eka9d0tkw1gh70i5/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/rahulpnath/asmspy/branch/master)

AsmSpy
------

A simple command line tool to view assembly references.

A MS task to detect not found dll at build time.

## MSTask parameters
| Parameters | Default values |
| --- | --- |
| Directory | Empty |
| IgnoreSubDirectories | false |
| NotFoundOnly | false |
| IgnoreNetStandard | false |
| IgnoreSystem | false |

## Install 

Install [from Chocolatey package](https://chocolatey.org/packages/asmspy):

    C:\> choco install asmspy

Or download [AsmSpy as a .zip here](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/rahulpnath/asmspy/branch/master/artifacts). The .zip file contains AsmSpy.exe.

## How it works

Simply run AsmSpy giving it a path to your bin directory (the folder where your project's assemblies live).

    AsmSpy D:\Source\sutekishop\Suteki.Shop\Suteki.Shop\bin

It will output a list of all conflicting assembly references. That is where different assemblies in your bin folder reference different versions of the same assembly.

### Switches:
| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| all | list all assemblies and references.<br> Supported formats:  -a, --all |
| nonsystem | ignore system assemblies. <br> Supported formats:  -n, --nonsystem |
| noconsole | do not show reference output on console.<br> Supported formats:  -nc, --noconsole |
| silent | do not show any output, only warnings and errors will be shown.<br> Supported formats:  -s, --silent |
| dgml | export dependancy graph to a dgml file.<br> Supported formats:  -dg \<filename\>, --silent \<filename\> |
| rsw | Will only analyze assemblies if their referenced assemblies starts with the given value.<br> Supported formats:  -rsw \<string\>, --referencedstartswith \<string\> |
| i | include subdirectories in search.<br> Supported formats:  -i, --includesub |

### Examples
To see a list of all assemblies and all references, just add the 'all' flag:

    AsmSpy D:\Source\sutekishop\Suteki.Shop\Suteki.Shop\bin --all
    
To ignore system assemblies, add the 'nonsystem' flag.

The output looks something like this:


	Reference: System.Runtime.Serialization
		3.0.0.0 by Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples.XmlRpc
		3.0.0.0 by Microsoft.Web.Mvc
		4.0.0.0 by Suteki.Shop
	Reference: System.Web.Mvc
		2.0.0.0 by Microsoft.Web.Mvc
		3.0.0.0 by MvcContrib
		3.0.0.0 by MvcContrib.FluentHtml
		3.0.0.0 by Suteki.Common
		2.0.0.0 by Suteki.Common
		3.0.0.0 by Suteki.Shop
		2.0.0.0 by Suteki.Shop
	Reference: System.ServiceModel.Web
		3.5.0.0 by Microsoft.Web.Mvc
	Reference: System.Web.Abstractions
		3.5.0.0 by Microsoft.Web.Mvc


You can see that System.Web.Mvc is referenced by 7 assemblies in my bin folder. Some reference 
version 2.0.0.0 and some version 3.0.0.0. I can now resolve any conflicts.

Color coding is used to more easily distinguish any problems.
* Green - referenced assembly found locally, in the specified directory
* Yellow - referenced assembly not found locally, but found installed in the [Global Assembly Cache](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yf1d93sz(v=vs.110).aspx)
* Red - referenced assembly missing
